# Tangiballs
A spherical sound looper aparatus

Presently under redevelopment. 
Originally designed for two HAPP trackballs (https://na.suzohapp.com/products/trackballs/56-0100-11HL) and using the BELA board (https://bela.io/) for audio handling.

Takes one mono input, records to one of ten buffers, each of two spheres can play the buffers as (kinda)spherical loops. 
Originally developed as fully analog tape head device, before conversion to software.
